# Econometrics navigator

## What is it?

*Econometrics navigator* (`100NightsOfEconometrics`) is a collaborative 
open source guide to econometrics featuring:

1. practitioner interviews
2. structured overviews of econmetric concepts and techniques
3. econometrics use cases of in macro, finance, risk, 
  policy evaluation and microeconomic research
4. data sources and software advice

We aim to make entry into the econometrics easy, highlight paths to self-study, 
show replication of important results, and appeal to intuition and practical 
experience, which is growingly exposed at Stack Overflow, Twitter and other media.

Extended version of developper intents is [found here](source/_no_show.txt)

## Tech stack

I write in markdown and put files together into HTML using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The HTML output is pushed to Github Pages.
I'm hopeful to produce a nicely looking PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) 
and LATEX.
