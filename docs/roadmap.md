### Articles and code

- write more articles and code for the main section

### Reproducibility

Add resources on reproducible research and why it has such a poor traction in economics

-  [this - 1](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc/blob/master/paper.md)
-  [this - 2](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc) 

DAG tools:

-  waf.io
-  invoke

### How to publish a textbook

Need an opensource textbook with interactive code examples, translation into Russian desired. 
Hard to see a combination of a static site generator, good theme and PDf export working smoothly.
