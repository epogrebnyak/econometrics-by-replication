Roadmap 
=======

Updated May 13, 2019.

In next versions, I would like to do the following:

### General 

-  draw a mindmap for econometrics (described in text) and put key textbooks on it
-  pay more attention to bayesian / causality

### Interactivity

- repl.it
- colab (no Julia)
- notebooks/binder

### Data science textbooks

-  Add  [deep learning links](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn/blob/master/deep_learning.md)
- [Data Science fo Economists](https://github.com/tyleransom/DScourseS18)

### Articles and code

- write more articles and code for the main section
- translate some RATS/MATLAB code to open source (esp time series)

Specific tasks:
- clean ols
- run pca example

### Reproducibility

Add resources on reproducible research and why it has such a poor traction in economics

-  [this - 1](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc/blob/master/paper.md)
-  [this - 2](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc) 

DAG tools:

-  waf.io
-  invoke

### How to publish a textbook

Need an opensource textbook with interactive code examples, translation into Russian desired. 
Hard to see a combination of a static site generator, good theme and PDf export working smoothly.

- Allen Downey on Medium
- jupyter-book
- bookdown

### Our publishing process

- things mentioned in [todo.txt](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/econometrics-navigator/blob/master/todo.txt)


### Other goals

- review 'depreciated' folder, and 'history' page
- 'vednorize' [LessOLS.jl](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/LessOLS.jl)
