Econometrics
============

General textbooks 
-----------------

- Thread about [picking a textbook](http://www.urch.com/forums/phd-economics/127240-just-finished-intro-wooldridge-gurajati-whats-best-text-next-self-study.html)

- Favorite introductory book: [Peter Kennedy. A Guide To Econometrics](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16057448950849214316&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&sciodt=0,5)

- Very condensed synopsis of [undergrad econometrics](https://github.com/tyleransom/EconometricsLabs/blob/master/econometricsCheatSheet.pdf)

Some well-known texts:

 - Greene 
 - Dougherty
 - Hayashi 
 - Stock and Watson
 - Verbeek
 - [Hansen. Econometircs](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf) 
 - [Sargent-Hansen](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/c10141.pdf)

Cross Section and Panel Data 
----------------------------

- [Wooldridge. Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data](http://bit.ly/2PsGoE6)
- [МНЕ](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8769.html), with criticisms by: 
  - Diebold: ["sub-sub-sub-area of applied econometrics"](https://fxdiebold.blogspot.com/2015/01/mostly-harmless-econometrics.html)
  - [J. Pearl](https://p-hunermund.com/2017/02/22/judea-pearl-on-angrist-and-pischke)

MHE is one of few books with excercises [reproduced on github](https://github.com/vikjam/mostly-harmless-replication).

Criticism of MHE:

> Rather, it's a companion for a highly-specialized group of applied non-structural micro-econometricians hoping to estimate causal effects using non-experimental data and largely-static, linear, regression-based methods. It's a novel treatment of that sub-sub-sub-area of applied econometrics, but pretending to be anything more is most definitely harmful, particularly to students, who have no way to recognize the charade as a charade.

- [Lecture Notes in Microeconometrics](https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/shortguides.htm) - nicely presented topics in econometrics for microeconomics from OLS to bootstrap, with guides to software.
