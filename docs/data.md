Data
====

Large collections
-----------------

- Python libraries [statsmodels, sci-learn and seaborn](https://kolesnikov.ga/Datasets_in_Python/)
and [R itself](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) have build-in datasets.

- gretl has extensive selection of datasets, including [data from key textbooks](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/gretl_data.html).

- Well known dataset repository is [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) obviously has plenty of datasets. 

- Sheffield University made a good  listing of [datasets for teaching](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mash/data).

- Australian National Centre for Econometric Research website has 
  a useful [Data and code](http://www.ncer.edu.au/resources/data-and-code.php)
  section. 

- [Google Dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) is not yet as good as 
  main Google search, but will surely improve.

- [FRED][fred], [Quandl][q] and [dbnomics][dbn] are standard sources for macroeconomic data. My own effort for clean Russian macro time series - [mini-kep](https://github.com/mini-kep).

  datasets and accompanying articles.

-  Nick Huntington-Klein provides a variety of extra examples of [data importable into R](http://nickchk.com/econometrics.html#Rdata).

- I extracted a small, but illustartive dataset about [lightbulb survival rate](https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE/status/1108438155554930688).   

- [Sunspot data](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=sunspot+data) is listed at variety of sources.
