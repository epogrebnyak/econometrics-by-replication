# Econometrics by replication

Stay fit and confident in your quantitative skills by replicating published research findings using open source software. 

I choose papers that are:

- important milestones, 'seminal', widely cited, or
- good subject area reviews, or
- easy to understand and replicate, honest and friendly to reader, or
- already have code and data attached,
- or sevral things from the above. 

# 1. Finance

## Exchange rates

- Messe/Rogoff
- review by Barabara Rossi
- anything by Sarno 

## Interest rates

- Nelson-Siegel 

## Value-at-risk

- There must be something easy and approachable

## Credit risk, IFRS

- There must be something easy and approachable 
- For now [this](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/offers/ifrs-9-cecl-model-regulations-compliance.html)

# 2. Macroeconometrics

- Kalman and other time series filtering, state space representation
- something on probability of recession from G Perez-Quiros
- stationarity of macro time series
- does Taylor rule work?
- Lucas critique (?)
- anything friendlier than Smets/Vouters for DSGE

# 3. Power sector

## Electricity prices

- Nektaria's and Derek's paper

# 4. Everything else

I know there are great replicable things throughout the JEL classification. I just do not know too much about them. 

## Policy evaluation

Anything they teach at [irvapp](https://irvapp.fbk.eu/trainings/detail/14117/irvapp-winter-school-2019-fundamentals-and-methods-for-impact-evaluation-of-public-policies-2019/), *a variety of statistical tools for counterfactual analysis (including Matching methods, Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuity Designs, Difference-in-Differences, and Synthetic Control Methods)*

# Bits of wisdom and good clues

# Some entry points I (probably should) often look 

Code and articles in econometrics is surprisingly rare,
econometricians seem not to like github. 

- Matlab tutorials in finance
- quantecon
- uni-replication 
- stackoverflow
- gretl examples
- journals, journals, journals

# Project notes 

## The big goals

1. Define a path to econometrics skill-building.  
2. Distill milestones (big and small) by subject area. 
3. Allow easy entry to a field.
4. Make complex things simple. 
5. Appeal to intuition and personal experiences. 
6. Tame jargon.
7. Use new data.

Comments:
(1, 2) sometimes there is too much of a choice of textbooks, courses and on-line material available.  

(3, 4) large parts of academia seem to have built-in incentives for complexity and for being self-referential. 
       That's how you protect your domain. Genuine knowledge is easy to grasp and deliever, if that is truely 
       your goal. 

(5) We have twitter now - people tell their pains and joys in doing the research. These are golden bits,
    but of course inferior to having a good supervisor and supporting peers. Twitter and stackoverflow, 
    I should say.    

(6) You do not 'train' an OLS regression.

(7) We have got free software, cheap computing power, downloadable data and open publishing! Lets go!

Non-goals:
- Big data 
- ML, AI, anything 2.0 

## Software

Any of: 

- R, python, julia
- Eviews, gretl
- Matlab, Octave
- SAS, SPSS, Stata
- RATS, Ox

If I had to choose two: R (libraries) and gretl (documentation).
If I had to choose one: python (it just runs).
Before open source: Eviews.
If I had more time: Julia.
Everything else: if I have to. 

## My (over)simplified view of econometrics curriculum

- some linear alg, calculus, propability
- OLS
- maximum likelihood
- time series
- panel data
- classifications
- systems of equations
- darker side of macro: DSGE
- bayesian estimation

## Supplements

- Glossary
- Textbooks
- Writing style
- Econometrics now and then - what changed?
