# Econometrics by replication

Stay fit and confident in your quantitative skills by replicating published 
research findings using open source software. 

# Subject areas

I choose papers that are any of:

- important milestones, 'seminal', widely cited
- good subject area reviews
- easy to understand and replicate, honest and friendly to reader
- already have code and data attached

## 1. Finance

### Exchange rates

- Messe/Rogoff
- review by Barabara Rossi
- anything by Sarno 

### Interest rates

- Nelson-Siegel 

### Value-at-risk

- There must be something easy and approachable

### Credit risk, IFRS

- There must be something easy and approachable

## 2. Macroeconometrics

- Kalman and other time series filtering 
- state space representation
- anything friendlier than Smets/Vouters for DSGE


## 3. Everything else


### Electricity prices

- Nektaria's paper

### Policy evaluation

Anything that 

### 

## Good entry points

Code and articles in econometrics is surprisingly rare,
econometricians seem not to like github. 

- Matlab tutorials in finance
- quantecon
- uni-replication 
- stackoverflow
- gretl examples

# Project notes 

## The big goals

1. Define a path to econometrics skill-building.  
2. Distill milestones (big and small) by subject area. 
3. Allow easy entry to a field.
4. Make complex things simple. 
5. Appeal to intuition and personal experiences. 
6. Tame jargon.
7. Use new data.

Comments:
(1, 2) sometimes there is too much of a choice of textbooks, courses and on-line material available.  

(3, 4) large parts of academia seem to have built-in incentives for complexity and for being self-referential. 
       That's how you protect your domain. Genuine knowledge is easy to grasp and deliever, if that is truely 
       your goal. 

(5) We have twitter now - people tell their pains and joys in doing the research. These are golden bits,
    but of course inferior to having a good supervisor and supporting peers. Twitter and stackoverflow, 
    I should say.    

(6) You do not 'train' an OLS regression.

(7) We have got free software, cheap computing power, downloadable data and open publishing! Lets go!

Non-goals:
- Big data 
- ML, AI, anything 2.0 

## Software

Any of: 

- R, python, julia
- Eviews, gretl
- Matlab, Octave
- SAS, SPSS, Stata
- RATS, Ox

If I had to choose two: R (libraries) and gretl (documentation).
If I had to choose one: python (it just runs).
Before open source: Eviews.
If I had more time: Julia.
Everything else: if I have to. 

## My (over)simplified view of econometrics curriculum

- some linear alg, calculus, propability
- OLS
- maximum likelihood
- time series
- panel data
- classifications
- systems of equations
- darker side of macro: DSGE
- bayesian estimation

## Supplements

- Glossary
- Textbooks
- Writing style
- Econometrics now and then - what changed?
