> The frequentist bandwagon really got rolling in the early 1900s. Ronald Fisher developed the maximum likelihood theory of optimal estimation, showing the best possible behavior for an estimate, and Jerzy Neyman did the same for confidence intervals and tests. Fisher’s and Neyman’s procedures were an almost perfect fit to the scientific needs and the computational limits of twentieth century science, casting Bayesianism into a shadow existence.
