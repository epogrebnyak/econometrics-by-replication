## Motivation

Back in graduate school I was perfectly happy with Greene, Dougherty,
EViews and Matlab. Now I code in Python more often than in R, and I feel 
amount of information about econometrics is immense to a degree 
it erodes confidence. 

To keep on coding and be sure I do econometrics right I wanted:

- a guide that helps refresh easier topics and navigate through more difficult ones 
- complex things told simply, less jargon and more intuitive appeal
- a good list of worthwhile articles to invest time replicating them
- credible references to share with students

A single guide of the type does not seem to exist, so I'm writing one. 

## What is happening now?

*November 11, 2018* 

 - updating [Twitter](tweets.md) posts page, plenty of information 
   with a personal appeal 
 - OLS, PCA and Bayesian inference seem to be first topics in 
   'Concepts and techniques' section
