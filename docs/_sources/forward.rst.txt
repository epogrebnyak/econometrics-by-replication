Foreword

## Motivation

Back in graduate school I was perfectly happy with Greene, Dougherty,
EViews and Matlab. Now I code in Python more often than in R, and I feel 
amount of information about econometrics is immense to a degree 
it erodes confidence. 

To get a grip I wanted a guide that helps refresh easier topics and 
navigates through more difficult ones. I really appretiate 
when complex things are made simple. I want less jargon and more intuitive 
appeal. I want milestones to cover and good list of worthwhile articles 
to invest time replicating them. I want to keep on coding 
and be sure I do econometrics right. Be able to speak to students and provide 
good references for their studies. 

A single of the type does not seem to exist, so I'm writing one. 

## What is happening now?

*November 11, 2018* 

 - updating `Twitter <tweets.md>`__ posts page, plenty of information 
   with a personal appeal 
 - OLS, PCA and Bayesian inference seem to be first topics in 
   'Concepts and techniques' section
