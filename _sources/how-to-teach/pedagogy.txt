Technical pedadogy
==================

Ideas
-----

- "Overarching education" (plenty of math and fundimentals, aimed at systemic thinking,      
  practical applications derived later) is expensive methoid of teaching
- Student motivation is scarce, information is abundant. Teaching is a guidance (esp masters level). 
- Can teach programming first, and followup with more solid math second, if ever (programming allows experimenting).
- Need open source textbooks, able to update and share parts of text as well as 
  interactive excercises. Static site generators are not fully there yet.

1\. [10 rules of teaching](http://third-bit.com/10rules/#teaching) by Greg Wilson (@gvwilson) starts with rule #1 "Be kind: all else is details." More detail is at [teachtogether.tech](http://teachtogether.tech/en/).
  
2\. Nick Huntington-Klein [proposes a course structure](https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1114956341913645058) based on statistical programming, and causal inference/research design, with regressions postponed. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, my class that goes at the *beginning* of the econometrics sequence, and focuses entirely on two things: statistical programming, and causal inference/research design.

4\. Very introductory courses are good for building student confidence and making simple things simple. They prevent gate-keeping (maybe a reason why they are attacked). See a thread by 
[Rochelle Terman on teaching computational social science](https://twitter.com/RochelleTerman/status/1126642900006252544).
