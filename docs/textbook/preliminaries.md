Mathematic preliminaries
========================

Typical prerequisites for statistics and econometrics are:

- linear algebra 
- calculus 
- probability

They usually take 2-4 semester in college. Linear algebra is fully covered by 
[VMLS][VMLS], and [Gilbert Strang][GS] lectures are highly recommended. Probability is exposed in [PSC][PSC], even though it is a compact reference, not formally a textbook. [Scipy lectures][Sci] are a great one-stop resource for numerical computing basics.

Linear Algebra
--------------

- [Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares (VLMS)][VMLS]

[VMLS]: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu

- [Gilbert Strang lectures on linear algebra][GS] get vocal 
  [acclaim from the former students](https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1199677021816799233),
  as a kind of course that helped students gain a lot of confidence 
  in the subject.

Another motivational book on linear algebra - from Moscow Programmers Club.

When Life is Linear - but it is paid content.

Calculus
--------

I do not have a one single source to recommend for calculus yet. Maybe it is a basic subject
with no reason for a new basic textbook to appear in. 

However, renewed interest for differentiation problems cames from deep learning subject area. 
*The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning* by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard 
is a prime resource for matrix calculus, it is accessble as:

- [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01528) 
- or as an nicely designed [web page](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html). 
 
Authors recommend [Khan Academy differential calculus course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus) as a starter, but it is not a single downloadable reference.

*fast.ai* also has a [calculus intro](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning),
going rather quickly from one-arg function derivatives to deep learning.

Probability and statistics
