## Motivation

Back in graduate school I was perfectly happy with Greene, Dougherty,
MicroTSP, EViews and Matlab. Now I code in Python, R and Julia and I feel amount of information about econometrics is immense to a degree 
it erodes confidence. There is also a wave of machine learning
and deep learning flocking over, a bit of a stress. 

To keep on happily coding I wanted:

- a guide that helps refresh easier econometrics topics and navigate 
  through more difficult ones 
- complex things told simply, less jargon and more intuitive appeal
- a good list of worthwhile articles to invest time replicating them
- credible references to accessible books, articles, tutorials
- something to share with students on occasional teaching

A single guide of the type does not seem to exist, so I'm writing (well, compiling) one.

I need help in shaping this guide and exposing it to readers to make it better.
