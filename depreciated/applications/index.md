===============

In this chapter we collect articles and chapters from several 
practical domains (macro, finance, risk and microeconomics) 
for study and replication.

## Macro

   - GDP
   - FX
   - interest rates
   - asset class allocation 
   - business cycle

   - search of invariants (Atillo Meucci)
   - [ARPM for risk](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/the-prayer-ten-step-checklist-for-advanced-risk-and-portfolio-management-with-attilio-meucci-81834.html)


Panel data:
   - *MHE*
   - policy assessment

### Interest rates

- Nelson-Siegel 

### Value-at-risk

- There must be something easy and approachable 
- For now [this](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/offers/ifrs-9-cecl-model-regulations-compliance.html)




## Macroeconometrics

- Kalman and other time series filtering, state space representation
- something on probability of recession from G Perez-Quiros
- stationarity of macro time series
- does Taylor rule work?
- Lucas critique (?)
- anything friendlier than Smets/Vouters for DSGE

## Power sector

### Electricity prices

- Nektaria's and Derek's paper


## Rest of JEL

I know there are great replicable things throughout the JEL classification. I just do not know too much about them. 

### Policy evaluation

Anything they teach at [irvapp](https://irvapp.fbk.eu/trainings/detail/14117/irvapp-winter-school-2019-fundamentals-and-methods-for-impact-evaluation-of-public-policies-2019/), *a variety of statistical tools for counterfactual analysis (including Matching methods, Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuity Designs, Difference-in-Differences, and Synthetic Control Methods)*
