# Econometrics navigator

*Econometrics Navigator* is an open source guide to econometrics. It is located at <https://epogrebnyak.github.io/econometrics-navigator>.

## Tech stack

I write in markdown and put documentation together into HTML using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). 
The HTML output is pushed to Github Pages. I'm hopeful to produce a nicely looking PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) 
and LaTeX.
