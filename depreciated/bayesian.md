> On paper at least, the subjective Bayesian and the so-called default Bayesians, or whatever they want to call themselves, are wildly different.  For the former the prior represents your beliefs apart from the data, where disagreement is accepted and expected, where at most there is long-run convergence.  Default Bayesians, by contrast, look up ‘reference’ priors that do not represent beliefs and might not even be probabilities, but give set rules to follow.  Yet in reality default Bayesians seem to want it both ways.  They say: ‘All I’m trying to do is give you a prior to use if you don’t know anything. But of course if you do have prior information, by all means, put it in.’  It’s an exercise that lets them claim to be objective, while inviting you to put in degrees of belief, if you have them. The prior, they like to say, gives a ‘reference’ to compare with
your subjective prior, but a reference for what?
