Developper intents
==================

### Notes

- Available tutorials are endless, but some meaningless 
- Cannot really substitute a course or a book with internet browsing
- Maybe develop own format on how to talk briefly about topics - 
  eg extended dictionary?
- There is code availble to inspect in statmodels, R and julia, 
  can browse into it. 
- Our way: experiment with code, systematize readings, nurture intuition.
- Todo: compile to pdf and print hard copy


**Goal**: refresh econometrics by reviewing and replicating 
          some working papers and connect the dots on a mindmap 
          of econometric methods.

**My starting point**: A's in grad econometrics in 2001 (MGU),
                       some PhD block courses in 2004 and 2013-2014 
                       (LBS, IfW, CEMFI, Barcelona GSE),
                       working knowledge of python/R,
                       taste for intuition and clean code.

**Implications**: 

- this may not be a good starter tutorial 
- there can be gaps, lacoons and omissions  
- practicing econometrician would have done this guide better 

**Methods:**

- simplifiy tasks and method description
- add domain knowledge
- do excercises in R, python, gretl and Julia
- refer to Eviews/Matlab 
- master writing latex formulas
- keep a dicitonary
- list your sources
- link to references
- use Stack Overflow and twitter for pointing to live discussions
- get other people to review


### Observations

- 'data science' became more appealing than econometrics
- panel vs time series data
