Mathematic preliminaries
========================

Typical prerequisites for statistics and econometrics are:

- linear algebra 
- calculus 
- probability

They usually take 2-4 semester in college. Linear algebra is fully covered by 
[VMLS][VMLS], and probability is exposed in [PSC][PSC], even though it is a compact reference, not formally a textbook. [Scipy lectures][Sci] are a great one-stop resource for numerical computing basics.

I do not have a one single source to recommend for calculus yet. 

Linear Algebra
--------------

- [Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares (VLMS)][VMLS]

[VMLS]: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu


<!--

TODO: Another motivational book on linear algebra - from Moscow Programmers Club.

Calculus
--------

[The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01528) 
recommends [Khan Academy differential calculus course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus), but it is not a single downloadable reference. *fast.ai*
also has a [calculus intro](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning), 
going from start to derivatives in deep learning quickly.


Probability and statistics
--------------------------

- [Probability and Statistics Cookbook (PSC)][PSC]

[PSC]: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tdw/files/cookbook-en.pd


Numerical computing
--------------------

- [Scipy lectures: one document to learn numerics, science, and data with Python][Sci]

[Sci]: http://www.scipy-lectures.org


Other
-----

- [140 unsorted formulas with a bit of Portugese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0RLknmL54khQlhGUzFUWEtncTA/view), nice for a bulk review. Prepared by [Rubens Zimbres](https://github.com/RubensZimbres).
- [Computational Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra) repository from *fast.ai*.
