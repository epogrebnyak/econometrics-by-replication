Roadmap 
=======

In next versions, I would like to do the following:

-  draw a mindmap for econometrics (described in text) and put key textbooks on it
-  write more articles and code for the main section
-  review 'depreciated' folder, and 'history' page
-  add resources on reproducible research and why it has such a poor traction in economics
-  add APIs to Data section and a lightbulb survival case, which is dear to me
-  pick couple resources on (technical) pedagogy - how to teach effectively
-  pay more attention to bayesian / causality
-  translate some RATS/MATLAB code to open source (esp time series)
-  'vednorize' `LessOLS.jl <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/LessOLS.jl>`__
-  add a bit more of `deep learning links <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn/blob/master/deep_learning.md>`__

- use data links from [nickchk](http://nickchk.com/econometrics.html#Rdata)
- things mentioned in `todo.txt <https://github.com/epogrebnyak/econometrics-navigator/blob/master/todo.txt>`__
