Foreword
========

Back in graduate school I was perfectly happy with Greene, Dougherty,
EViews and Matlab. Now I code in Python more often than in R, and I feel 
amount of information about econometrics is immense to a degree 
it erodes confidence. 

Not that we have more spam tutorials and ivory-tower self-referring paywall 
articles, there is quite a bit of personal communication (eg Twitter, 
Stack Overflow, blogs) that just does make sense. 

For myself, I want a guide that can help refresh some econometrics and 
help navigate through more difficult topics by making complex things simple. 
I want less jargon and more intuitive appeal. I want milestones to cover and 
worthwhile articles to invest time replicating them. I want to keep on coding 
and be sure I do econometrics right. Be able to speak to students and provide 
good study references. 

Such a guide does not seem to exist, so I'm writing one. 
Feel free to contact me on `@PogrebnyakE <https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE>`_ 
about the draft.
