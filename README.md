## What is it?

*Econometrics navigator* is a collaborative 
open source guide to econometrics featuring:

1. practitioner interviews
2. structured overviews of econometric concepts and techniques, featuring 
   toy code examples 
3. use cases of in macro, finance, risk, policy evaluation and microeconomic research

show replication of important results, and appeal to intuition.

## Tech stack

I write in markdown and put documentation together into HTML using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). 
The HTML output is pushed to Github Pages. I'm hopeful to produce a nicely looking PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) 
and LaTeX.
