## Motivation

Back in graduate school I was perfectly happy with Greene, Dougherty,
EViews and Matlab. Now I code in Python (and rarely in R) and I feel 
amount of information about econometrics is immense to a degree 
it erodes confidence. 

To keep on happily coding I wanted:

- a guide that helps refresh easier econometrics topics and navigate 
  through more difficult ones 
- complex things told simply, less jargon and more intuitive appeal
- a good list of worthwhile articles to invest time replicating them
- credible references to accessible books, articles, tutorials
- something to share with students on occasional teaching

A single guide of the type does not seem to exist, so I'm writing one. 

## What is happening now?

*November 11, 2018* 

 - updating [Twitter](tweets.md) posts page, plenty of information 
   with a personal appeal 
 - several articles appearing in 'Concepts and techniques' section

I need help in shaping this guide and exposing it to readers to make it better.
