Welcome to Econometrics Navigator!
==================================

Goals
-----

The Econometrics Navigator (EN) goal is to make quality instruction in 
statictics and econometrics accessible.

Let's lower the barrier for entry and prevent gate-keeping!

Types of content
----------------

We aim to provide you with:

- open access textbooks and community knowledge (reddit, 
  StackOverflow, Twitter threads),
- minimal code examples in Python, R, gretl or Julia,
- datasets and cases for quantative analysis, 
- ideas on how to structure your learning paths.

1. Own articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The articles are in `Concepts and techniques section <topics/index.rst>`__,  
organised alphabetically. Finished examples are:

- `Maximum likelihood <topics/max-likelihood.html>`__
- `Bootstrap <topics/bootstrap.html>`__
- `ANOVA <topics/anova.html>`__

2. Textbooks guide  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Textbooks review <textbook/index.html>`__ attempts to sort out and annotate textbooks and 
references by several categories, starting from math preliminaries and up to ML/DL 
applications.

In econometrics the categories are 'general' textbooks, cross-section/panel, time series 
and bayesian texts. Whatever I could not document well, I did put in the 
`mindmap <textbook/mindmap.html>`__ section.

The backstage workings of the Navigator are `History of econometrics <textbook/history.html>`__, 
`Ways to review econometrics <textbook/ways-into-econometrics.html>`__. 

Review of resources about mathematic statistics are still a `draft <textbook/statistics.html>`__.

3. Better teaching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These documents organise thinking about better teaching of 
econometrics in terms of sequence of topics, better analogies 
for the learner and a faster bridge to coding and working 
with real data from formulas and concepts. Specifically I collected
the links about `technical pedagogy here <textbook/how-to-teach.html>`__.


Twitter 
-------

So far twitter has been an enormously valuable source of demos, links and opinion for me.
I keep a `separate page with twitter posts <tweets.html>`__, some of my favorites are:
