Mathematic preliminaries
========================

Typical prerequisites for statistics and econometrics are:

- linear algebra 
- calculus 
- probability

They usually take 2-4 semester in college. Linear algebra is fully covered by 
[VMLS][VMLS], and probability is exposed in [PSC][PSC], even though latter is a compact reference, not formally a textbook. Scipy lectures is a great one-stop resource for numerical computing basics. I do not have a one single source to recommend for calculus yet.
