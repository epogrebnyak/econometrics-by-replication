Job description in ML
---------------------

Knowledge of machine learning and some typical frameworks for machine learning and computational
statistics (e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch, MXNet, Scikit-Learn, R packages in the CRAN Machine Learning task view, Stan). Strong understanding of the different methods – at the very minimum at the level of “intelligent user” of packaged methods, but ideally also knowing the algorithmic details at the level of being able to modify existing learning methods and even write new ones from scratch.

Knowledge of statistics/econometrics, (statistical inference, time series analysis, 
panel/longitudinal data analysis, ЩДЫ).

Knowledge of typical big data tooling, preferably with experience in Spark and Impala.
Strong knowledge of data engineering – including databases (both relational and not relational),
data I/O, cleansing, and transformation is highly desired, including advanced SQL analytical 
extensions for longitudinal data

Polished communications and data visualization highly desirable.  Familiarity with patterns 
and typical libraries (e.g. D3.js, Material) and application frameworks (e.g. R’s Shiny, 
Angular, Polymer etc.) commonly used to build highly interactive analytical applications
