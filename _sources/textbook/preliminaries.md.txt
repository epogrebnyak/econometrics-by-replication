Preliminaries
==============

Typical prerequisites for econometrics are:

- linear algebra 
- calculus 
- probability
- mathematic statistics 

They usually take 2-4 semester in college. Linear algebra is fully covered by 
VLMS, and probability is exposed in PSC, even though latter is a compact reference, 
not formally a textbook. Scipy lectures is a great one-stop resource for numerical computing basics. I do not have a one single source to recommend for calculus yet.
