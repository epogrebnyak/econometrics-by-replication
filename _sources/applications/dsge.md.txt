A DSGE in Julia
---------------
- [model description](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr647.html)
- [git repo](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl)
- [a very balanced comment](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl/blob/master/doc/MatlabToJuliaTransition.md) from people who seem to know what they are doing with Julia:

> As Julia users, we can now pull in high-quality, fully tested, community-supported external packages that can each be installed or updated with a single command. This reduces the need for users to create their own, likely lower-quality functionality, increasing developer and code performance. (Or the need to fight for the toolbox licenses available to their department.)

>Converting the FRBNY DSGE model from MATLAB, a mature and well-supported language, to an extremely young language like Julia involved no shortage of challenges.

<!-- -->
> After months of hard work, we are pleased to be able to increase the performance of our model and provide our project for the benefit of the community. For those considering similar projects, we find the benefits of a transition to Julia are significant. One should, however, be realistic about the challenges that will be faced transitioning to a young language.
