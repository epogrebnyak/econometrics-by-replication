Goals
=====

1. Access to knowledge  

  - Allow easy entry to econometrics field.   
  - Define a path to econometrics skill-building at different levels.  
  - Distill milestones by subject area.  

2. Style and approach  
  - Make complex things simple.  
  - Appeal to intuition and personal experiences.  
  - Tame jargon.  
  - Use new data and free tools.  


Developper intents
==================

### Notes

- Available tutorials are endless, but some meaningless 
- Cannot really substitute a course or a book with internet browsing
- Maybe develop own format on how to talk briefly about topics - 
  eg extended dictionary?
- There is code availble to inspect in statmodels, R and julia, 
  can browse into it. 
- Our way: experiment with code, systematize readings, nurture intuition.
- Todo: compile to pdf and print hard copy


**Goal**: refresh econometrics by reviewing and replicating 
          some working papers and connect the dots on a mindmap 
          of econometric methods.

**My starting point**: A's in grad econometrics in 2001 (MGU),
                       some PhD block courses in 2004 and 2013-2014 
                       (LBS, IfW, CEMFI, Barcelona GSE),
                       working knowledge of python/R,
                       taste for intuition and clean code.

**Implications**: 

- this may not be a good starter tutorial 
- there can be gaps, lacoons and omissions  
- practicing econometrician would have done this guide better 

**Methods:**

- simplifiy tasks and method description
- add domain knowledge
- do excercises in R, python, gretl and Julia
- refer to Eviews/Matlab 
- master writing latex formulas
- keep a dicitonary
- list your sources
- link to references
- use Stack Overflow and twitter for pointing to live discussions
- get other people to review


### Observations

- 'data science' became more appealing than econometrics
- panel vs time series data

From readme
===========

Stay fit and confident in your quantitative skills by replicating published research findings using open source software. 

# Some entry points I (probably should) often look 

Code and articles in econometrics is surprisingly rare,
econometricians seem not to like github. 

- Matlab tutorials in finance
- quantecon
- uni-replication 
- [stackoverflow](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/least-squares?sort=votes)
- gretl examples
- [ARPM for risk](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/the-prayer-ten-step-checklist-for-advanced-risk-and-portfolio-management-with-attilio-meucci-81834.html)

# Project notes 

## The big goals

1. Define a path to econometrics skill-building at different levels.  
2. Distill milestones (big and small) by subject area. 
3. Allow easy entry to econometrics field.
4. Make complex things simple. 
5. Appeal to intuition and personal experiences. 
6. Tame jargon.
7. Use new data and free tools. 

Comments:
(1, 2) sometimes there is too much of a choice of textbooks, courses and on-line material available.  

(3, 4) large parts of academia seem to have built-in incentives for complexity and for being self-referential. 
       That's how you protect your domain. Genuine knowledge is easy to grasp and deliever, if that is truely 
       your goal. 

(5) We have twitter now - people tell their pains and joys in doing the research. These are golden bits,
    but of course inferior to having a good supervisor and supporting peers. Twitter and stackoverflow, 
    I should say.    

(6) You do not 'train' an OLS regression.

(7) We have got free software, cheap computing power, downloadable data and open publishing! Lets go!

Non-goals:
- Big data 
- ML, AI, anything 2.0 

## Software

Any of: 

- R, python, julia
- Eviews, gretl
- Matlab, Octave
- SAS, SPSS, Stata
- RATS, Ox

If I had to choose two: R (libraries) and gretl (documentation).
If I had to choose one: python (it just runs).
Before open source: Eviews.
If I had more time: Julia.
Everything else: if I have to. 

## My (over)simplified view of econometrics curriculum

- some linear alg, calculus, propability
- OLS
- maximum likelihood
- time series
- panel data
- classifications
- systems of equations
- darker side of macro: DSGE
- bayesian estimation

## Supplements

- Glossary
- Textbooks
- Writing style
- Econometrics now and then - what changed?
