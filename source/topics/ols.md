## Ordinary least squares, OLS

Math: Y = BX + e    

Assumptions:
   - e is normally distributed

Common steps:
   0. think of what may explain what
   1. specify model: select regressors, transform variables
   2. estimate coefficients
   3. elaborate on model quality (hardest part) 
   4. to go 0 or 1 if needed
   5. know what model *does not* show (next hardest part)

What may go wrong:
   - residuals are not random
   - variables are cointegrated 
   - multicollinearity in regressors 
   - residuals depend on x (heteroscedasticity)
   - inference is not causality
   - wrong signs, insignificant coefficients
   - variable normalisation was not described 

Discussion:
   - why sum of squares as a loss function?
   - connections to bayesian estimation
