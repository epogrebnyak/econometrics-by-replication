Roadmap 
-------

## November 09, 2019

- drafts for cases and excercises
- add more tweets
- add from twitter personalities - links to them
- Section 4 History may go somewhere else
- logit models, tweets about them
- add presentation about reproducibility
- Statistical inference section is still a draft

## May 13, 2019

### General 

-  draw a mindmap for econometrics (as described in text) 
-  put key textbooks on a roadmap
-  pay more attention to bayesian / causality

### Data science textbooks

- [Data Science fo Economists](https://github.com/tyleransom/DScourseS18)

### Articles and code

- write more articles and code for the main section
- translate some RATS/MATLAB code to open source (especially time series)

Specific tasks:
- clean ols
- run pca example

### Reproducibility

Add resources on reproducible research and why it has such a poor traction in economics

-  [this - 1](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc/blob/master/paper.md)
-  [this - 2](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc) 

DAG tools:

-  waf.io
-  invoke

### How to publish a textbook

Need an opensource textbook with interactive code examples, translation into Russian desired. 
Hard to see a combination of a static site generator, good theme and PDf export working smoothly.

- Allen Downey on Medium
- jupyter-book
- bookdown

### Our publishing process

- things mentioned in [todo.txt](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/econometrics-navigator/blob/master/todo.txt)


### Other goals

- review 'depreciated' folder, and 'history' page
- 'vednorize' [LessOLS.jl](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/LessOLS.jl)
