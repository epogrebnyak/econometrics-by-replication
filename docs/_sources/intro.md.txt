# Introduction

This publication is still a draft. 

I define the publication goals as follwoing: 

1. Access to knowledge  
1.1. Allow easy entry to econometrics field.   
1.2. Define a path to econometrics skill-building at different levels.  
1.3. Distill milestones (big and small) by subject area.  

2. Style and approach  
2.1. Make complex things simple.  
2.2. Appeal to intuition and personal experiences.  
2.3. Tame jargon.  
2.4. Use new data and free tools.  

More soul-searching on how to make this guide better can be found [here](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/econometrics-navigator/blob/master/source/_no_show.txt).
