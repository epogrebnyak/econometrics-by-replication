Welcome to Econometrics Navigator!
==================================

My goal is to illustrate key topics in econometrics with minimal code 
in Python, R or Julia and provide links to quality open source textbooks, 
popular Stack Overflow answers, short videos and twitter threads.

My checklist for a good topic is:

- you could have learned it before, but now forgot
- simple, minimal code example illustrates it
- links provided navigate you through the tutorial chaos
- someone knowledgable read the article and approved it

First articles  
---------------


- `Maximum likelihood <topics/max-likelihood.md>`__
- `Bootstrap <topics/bootstrap.md>`__
- `History of econometrics <special/history.md>`__
- `Good clues from Twitter <tweets.md>`__
